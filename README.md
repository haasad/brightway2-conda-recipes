# brightway2-conda-recipes

Conda build recipes for the brightway2 conda packages

- I originally created these with `conda skeleton pypi brightway2` etc.
- I modified them to use jinja variables the same way that [conda-forge does this](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/blob/master/recipes/example/meta.yaml).
- sha256 values need to be taken from the [pypi warehouse](https://pypi.org/project/brightway2/#files)
